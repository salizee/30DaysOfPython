# Get user input using input(“Enter your age: ”). 
# If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive. 
# If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years. Output:

# Enter your age: 30
# You are old enough to learn to drive.
# Output:
# Enter your age: 15
# You need 3 more years to learn to drive.
